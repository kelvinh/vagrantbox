My vagrant configuration of Archlinux box, based on *ogarcia/archlinux-x64*, thanks to this great box!

* Installation:

1. clone this repo
2. copy your ssh private key to the repo's folder(it will be copied to the box, and used to do authentication with GitHub/BitBucket, so you don't need to setup another authentication key for them)
3. run =vagrant up=, wait for the provision to finish

* TODO:

1. make hard coded web proxy configurable.
